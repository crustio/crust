    > Hints
      
  - Use `-m` flag to use a Chinese cargo mirror, cargo package downloads will be much faster for Chinese users.
  - Use `-c` flag to specify a custom cargo cache location,
        it defaults to docker/.cache, you may want to change it if you want share cargo cache between multiple clones.
  - Use `-r` to perform a full build (equals to `cargo clean & cargo build`).
  - Use `-p` to push to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

- Then, build and push crust (with `docker push`)

    ```bash
    docker/build.sh
    ```
